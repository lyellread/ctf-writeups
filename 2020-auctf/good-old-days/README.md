### Solution

Wayback Machine, here I come! This is the most useful view of the captures for the site `ctf.auburn.edu`: https://web.archive.org/web/sitemap/https://ctf.auburn.edu/. It shows that, among other subdirectories (and trust me, I visited each a couple times), the `/users` and `/users/50` pages have both been captured. 

https://web.archive.org/web/20200213064621/https://ctf.auburn.edu/users has a user called `auctf{Th053_w3rE_Th3_guD_0l3_d4y5}` - why it has to be at the end of that page, I don't know (I checked the top half a couple times during my research).

auctf{Th053_w3rE_Th3_guD_0l3_d4y5}
