### Solution:

Now for a much more real-world OSINT challenge. First, I started by doing a bit of recon. I ascertained that:

- `AU` in `AUCTF` is for Auburn University ([homeapge](https://www.auburn.edu/))
- `AUCTF` is run by members of the `AUEHC` ([Auburn University Ethical Hacking Club](https://ehc.auburn.edu/)). `AUEHC` is comprised of members:
	- President - Jordan Sosnowski: jjs@auburn.edu
	- Vice President - DeMarcus Campbell: dec0013@auburn.edu
	- Treasure - Luke Gleba: ljg0019@auburn.edu
	- Technical Lead - Charlie Harper: cah0111@auburn.edu
	- Technical Lead - Drew Batten: akb0046@auburn.edu
	- [Source](https://ehc.auburn.edu/about/)
- `AUCTF` Discord is run by discord users:
	- c AKA _c#9643
	- FireKing AKA Iamfireking#2686
	- JohnsonJangler AKA JohnsonJangler#0353
	- Kensocolo AKA Kensocolo#1000
	- nadrojisk AKA nadrojisk#6700
	- OG_Commando AKA The OG Commando#6632
	- vincent AKA FlaminArrowz#5042
	- 死神 (shinigami) AKA demarcus1621#6819
- `AUEHC` also has a [Github Organization](https://github.com/auehc), which the following github users are a part of:
	- Demarcus Campbell AKA demarcus1621
	- Jordan Sosnowski AKA nadrojisk
	- Vincent Chu AKA vincentchu37
- Within that organization are repos for:
	- [AUCTF-2020](https://github.com/auehc/AUCTF-2020) Which contains entirely commits by `nadrojisk`, with a pending pull request formulated by `demarcus1621`, with nothing interesting in it. 
	- [Their site](https://github.com/auehc/auehc.github.io)
	- Past competitions, mostly irrelevant to this challenge.
- Reddit account has posted three things, none of which are of use here: https://www.reddit.com/user/auehc/ 
- CTFTime Team `AUEHC` only has one player, `nadrojisk`. https://ctftime.org/team/82180

With that in mind, I went about composing this table:

| Name              | Discord                                | Github                          | Gitlab                                 | Twitter                       | Notes                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Jordan Sosnowski  | nadrojisk AKA nadrojisk#6700           | https://github.com/nadrojisk    | NA                                     | https://twitter.com/nadrojisk | All commits to the challenge repo. Prime suspect. Nothing interesting on twitter                                                          |
| Vincent Chu       | vincent AKA FlaminArrowz#5042          | https://github.com/vincentchu37 | https://github.com/vincentchu37/gitlab | Private                       | Has commits to the site @ https://github.com/auehc/auehc.github.io, https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentchu37/                             |
| Demarcus Campbell | 死神 (shinigami) AKA demarcus1621#6819 | https://github.com/demarcus1621 | NA                                     | Does not Exist                | Has pull request to auehc/AUCTF-2020 @ https://github.com/auehc/AUCTF-2020/pull/1 but changes only to README.md, and from private repo :( |
| Abhinav V.        | Kensocolo AKA Kensocolo#1000           | NA                              | NA                                     | https://twitter.com/kensocolo | Twitter, not much found                                                                                                                   |
| Charlie Harper    | c AKA _c#9643                          | https://github.com/chharles     | NA                                     | NA                            | Pretty sure this is Charlie Harper                                                                                                        |

The flag was in a repo that was *conveniently* not pinned in Vincent Chu's github. This was in one of the past commits in their repo `AUCTF-2020` [link](https://github.com/vincentchu37/AUCTF-2020/commit/56721948f12e3a76a5316c62ad2bcf47e8119926) [archive](http://archive.today/2020.04.06-032243/https://github.com/vincentchu37/AUCTF-2020/commit/56721948f12e3a76a5316c62ad2bcf47e8119926) made by github user `chharles`, who I have retroactively added to the table above.
