All,

I was told a story recently about a person who had his briefcase stolen
while on a business trip. He lost everything. Inside the briefcase was
his passport, wallet, house keys, car keys and cash. I guess no one told
him NOT to keep everything in one place! He immediately went back to his
hotel room and dialed the numbers listed below. The only thing the thieves
got was a free tank of gas. They literally filled their tank within 2
blocks of the hotel. But that is all they got. After calling the numbers
below, the next call was to the local police department. A call was then
made to his hometown Department of Motor Vehicles and Social Security
office. He then called his wife requesting she get all the locks changed
on the house and cars immediately. This is excellent advice. Another
good piece of advise is to place the contents of your wallet on a
photocopy machine, do both sides of each license, credit card, etc. You
will know what you had in your wallet along with the account numbers and
the phone numbers to call in case you need to cancel. Keep the copy in a
safe place.

We have all heard horror stories about fraud that is committed using
someone else's name, address, social security number, credit, etc. Here
is some critical information to limit the damage in case this happens to
you. As everyone always advises, cancel your credit cards immediately,
but the key is having the toll free phone numbers and your credit card
numbers handy so you will know whom to call. Keep these where you can
find them easily. File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction
where the theft occurred. This proves to credit providers you were
diligent. It is also the first step toward an investigation. But here's
what is perhaps most important (I never thought of doing this) - Call the
three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place a FRAUD
ALERT on your name and social security number. The alert means any
company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen. They
have to contact you by phone, at a number you provide, to authorize any
new credit.

I hope you never need this information. If you do, I hope you find it
helpful. Feel free to share this e-mail with others. Together, we can
fight crime!
